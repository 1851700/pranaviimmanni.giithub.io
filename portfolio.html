                       <h1><center>In my groups 1.1.9 project, we have decided to create a personalized, interactive drawing software that allows the user to 
                                select variuos objects to draw and colors with which to fill them. The user could choose from a butterfly, apple, snowman or car,
                                and each choice had three color options. Red, pink, blue, purple, black, and gray. The software would generate their personal 
                                drawing and add a moving sun in the background after the user entered their drawing, the chosen color, and later clicked run.<h1><center>
