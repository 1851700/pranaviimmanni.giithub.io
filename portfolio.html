                                select various objects to draw and colors with which to fill them. The user could choose from a butterfly, apple, snowman or car,
                                and each choice had three color options. The software would generate their personalized drawing and add a moving sun in the background 
                                after the user entered their drawing, the chosen color, and later clicked enter. </div>
